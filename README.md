Windows7 64-Bit
Windows 8.1 64-Bit

Ratoc is almost PlugÂ´n Play, very easy to configure.
has HD50 Male, requires HD50-Female to Centronics 50-Pin Male adapter/converter.

SCSI Terminator, and Firewire Cable 6-6 "400-400" or 9-6 "800-400"

IF Using the Ratocsystems FireWire to SCSI adapter FireREX1 or FS1SX
Firmware 1.23 1.32 or 1.36
can be used with FireWire800 9-pin to FireWire400 6-pin cable.
Some old laptops have Firewire 4-pin to 6-pin untested.

Ratoc SCSI converter or ATTO SCSI PCIe must be configured to be Async, Not Sync 5MB-10MB-20MB-40MB.
Scanners are Async.

The Free Ratoc Configurator Tool for PowerMac G4 works in OSX SnowLeopard 10.6.8 for intel with Rosetta PPC CPU emulator if installed.
also Ratoc has a Free config tool for WindowsXP 32-Bit, 64-Bit untested.

There is an optional paid Config Tool $20usd. in the Japan Ratoc web store. 
English website store is broken,

To purchase the optional config tool + 1.36 FW.
requires Website translator, Chrome or browser.Yandex.com 
Select Standard Ground Shipping and will give automatically a Download Link.
Japanese websites are strange.

The Optional paid config tool + Firmware 1.36 its designed for Windows Vista Only, 
does Not work in Windows8.1 64-Bit, using Vista compatibility installs, runs, but does Not detect the Scsi converter, gives error.
Windows7 64-Bit untested, but probaly wont work.
Optional paid Config Tool is Vista Only.

The 1.36 Firmware vs. Free 1.32 or 1.23 is the aditional support for Power Management Stand-By feature for FireWire introduced in Vista.
Older FirmWare does Not have that, FireWire Power is Always ON.

Install Driver in Windows8.1 from Device Manager,
Select Have a Disk,
will ask what kind of Driver is...
select Image Devices.
Should be a Imacon or Hasselblad manufacturer, but Not the Scanner 343, Photo, 646, Precision II, Precision III, etc...
choose disk...
Download this .inf file
search x64.INF in your download folder
select proper Scanner from List.
Reboot,
DONE.

FlexColor 4.0.3 should detect the scanner at start-up,
but scanner must be Turned-On before opening the FlexColor Software,
at least 3 minutes, to allow Imacon scanner to Boot, or FlexColor Software wont detect it.
Imacon Photo scanner has a 386sx CPU, with 4MB of RAM.
cant remember the Speed 20MHz, 33MHz?
Anyway, it needs time to boot.

Software options should be different,
Default options are for Digital Cameras.
Scanner Serial ID should be in Devices Menu in FlexColor 4.0.3 SW.

2. Set Windows in Test mode, to Allow Test Signed Driver.
bcdedit /set testsigning on
But this method only works with TestSigned drivers.
This driver is Old XP era, probably this method wont work.
