You need Hasselblad FlexColor 4.0.3 thats the latest version that supports SCSI scanners.
after installing,
The 32-Bit .INF driver is located on C:/Program Files (32-Bit)/Hasselblad/INF
That driver is for 32-Bit Only, Does Not work.
requires a small modification to allow Windows Imagine Devices to Detect the Driver in 64-Bit Windows. 

Tested:
XP 64-Bit, Vista 64-Bit, Windows7 64-Bit, Windows 8.1 64-Bit, Windows 10 64-Bit, Windows 11 untested.

Problem #1.

Then Windows will boot normally,

SCSI Requires an Active or Passive Centronics SCSI 50-pin Male terminator dongle.
SCSI Terminator is Not Low to GND, is High to 66% +Vcc, Active Terminator Recomended, has voltage regulators more precise than Passive Resistor Network or Diode Voltage Divider.
The best made were from GraniteDigital Part# 7359

Ratoc FireREX1 | FS1SX is almost PlugÂ´n Play, very easy to configure, 
has HD50 SCSI Male, requires HD50-Female to Centronics 50-Pin Male adapter/converter.
http://www.granitedigital.com/50fmicrodto50mcentronics.aspx
SCSI Terminator, and Firewire Cable 6-6 "400-400" or 9-6 "800-400", 
AC-DC Adapter is Not needed, Imacon Scanners Powers the Ratoc scsi converter.

IF Using Ratocsystems FireWire to SCSI adapter: 
Firmware 1.23 1.33 or 1.36
can be used with FireWire800 9-pin to FireWire400 6-pin cable.
Some old laptops have Firewire 4-pin to 6-pin untested.

Ratoc FW-to-SCSI converter or ATTO SCSI PCIe must be configured to be Async, Not Sync 5MB-10MB-20MB-40MB.
Scanners are Async.

Free Ratoc Configurator Tool for PowerMac G4 works in OSX SnowLeopard 10.6.8 for intel with Rosetta PPC CPU emulator if installed.
also Ratoc has a Free config tool for WindowsXP 32-Bit Only, 64-Bit untested, does Not work in Vista, W7, W8.1, W10.

There is an optional paid ConfigTool $20usd. in the Japan Ratoc web store. 
English web store is broken,

To purchase the optional configtool v1.60 + FirmWare 1.36
requires Website translator, Chrome, Vivaldi or browser.Yandex.com 
Select Standard Ground Shipping and will give automatically a Download Link at Check-Out.
Japanese websites are strange.

Optional paid configtool v1.60 + Firmware 1.36 is designed for Windows Vista, 
Paid ConfigTool v1.60 does Not work in Windows8.1 64-Bit with Vista compatibility, installs, runs, but does Not detect FireREX | FS1SX converter, gives Error.
Windows7 64-Bit untested, probably wont work.
Paid ConfigTool v1.60 is Vista Only.
Free ConfigTool v1.46 is XP Only.

Paid Firmware 1.36 vs. Free 1.33 or 1.23 is the aditional support for Power Management Stand-By feature for FireWire introduced in Vista.
Older Firmware 1.33 or 1.23 does Not have that, FireWire Power is Always ON.
FW 1.23 maybe required in OS9.2 and older OSX 10.2

Install .inf Driver in Windows8.1 from Device Manager,
Select Have a Disk,
will ask what kind of Driver is...
select Image Devices.
Should be a Imacon or Hasselblad manufacturer, but Not the Scanner 343, Photo, 646, Precision II, Precision III, etc...
choose disk...
Download this .inf file
search x64.INF in your download folder
select proper Scanner from List.
Wait until install is complete, takes time.
Reboot,
DONE.

FlexColor 4.0.3 should detect the scanner at start-up,
but scanner must be Turned-On before opening the FlexColor Software,
at least 3 minutes, to allow Imacon scanner to Boot, or FlexColor Software wont detect it.
Imacon Photo scanner has a 386sx CPU, with 4MB of RAM.
cant remember the Speed 20MHz, 33MHz?
Anyway, it needs time to boot.

Software options should be different,
Default FC options are for Digital Cameras.
Scanner Serial ID should be in Devices Menu in FlexColor 4.0.3 SW.

2. Set Windows in Test mode, to Allow Test Signed Driver.
bcdedit /set testsigning on
But this method only works with TestSigned drivers.
This driver is Old XP era, probably this method wont work. Untested.
